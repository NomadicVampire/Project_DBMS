HOW TO RUN OUR PHP and MYSQL DRIVEN ONLINE BIDDING SYSTEM-XBID

·         Install XAMPP in your computer systems. I am sharing a youtube link if you need help in installation of XAMPP. 
	(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8N4FEQWyY)

·         Now after installation start APACHE and MYSQL server.
	(Sometimes it throws errors while starting MYSQL because of a port that is already in use with mySQL workbench so you need to go to your system services and disable your MYSQL80 service. After this you are fine to go.)

·         After default installation of XAMPP go to C:\xampp\htdocs this is the directory where your project resides. Just copy paste our XBID folder here in C:\xampp\htdocs.

·         Now in XAMPP click on MYSQL admin button this is your http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ where you find all your DATABASE, on the navbar you’ll find import DATABASE section just click on it and upload our xbid.sql and click GO.

·         Now you are done! Just start the APACHE and MYSQL server and go to your explorer and type http://localhost/XBID / and START BIDDING.
